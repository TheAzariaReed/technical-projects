# Game System — Postmortem Analysis

## Overview
This project documents a postmortem-style evaluation of a game-based system, focusing on system behavior, constraints, and improvement opportunities.

## Evaluation Scope
- System interaction and usability
- Strengths and failure points
- Limitations and future improvements

## Evidence
- **Postmortem Report:**  
  `Writing/GameSystem_Postmortem_Report.pdf`
- **Briefing Deck:**  
  `Presentations/GameSystem_Postmortem_Briefing.pdf`

## Purpose
The documentation mirrors professional engineering postmortems used to inform iteration, risk mitigation, and system refinement.
