# Auto MPG — SVR vs ANN Model Validation

## Overview
This project evaluates and compares two predictive modeling approaches—Support Vector Regression (SVR) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)—using automotive efficiency data. The emphasis is on **validation, diagnostics, and evidence-backed conclusions**.

## Objective
- Compare predictive accuracy across modeling approaches
- Assess training behavior and convergence
- Identify error patterns using diagnostic visualizations

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Independent model pipelines for SVR and ANN
- Test-set evaluation using quantitative error metrics
- Visualization of predicted vs actual performance

## Evidence
- **Technical Report:** `Writing/AutoMPG_ModelValidation_Report.pdf`
- **Code:** `Code/`
- **Briefing Deck:** `Presentations/AutoMPG_ModelValidation_Briefing.pdf`

## Key Findings
- Model behavior and performance differences are supported by measured results
- Diagnostic plots provide insight into error distribution and generalization

## Limitations
- Dataset constraints and assumptions are documented in the report
- Results reflect the scope and inputs used in this analysis
