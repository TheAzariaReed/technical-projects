# Machine Learning Foundations — Analytical Pipelines

This section contains a set of analytical pipelines developed to evaluate regression and classification techniques under varying constraints.

## Contents

### Linear Regression — Gradient Descent Analysis
- End-to-end regression pipeline
- Loss behavior and convergence analysis

### Multivariate Regression — Feature Normalization Study
- Feature scaling and multivariate modeling
- Comparison of optimization vs closed-form solutions

### Logistic Regression — Classification Evaluation
- Binary classification workflow
- Performance assessment using classification metrics

## Purpose
These analyses demonstrate the ability to:
- Design evaluation pipelines
- Interpret model behavior
- Communicate results through metrics and structure
